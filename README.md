# Solar-syetem
This is a solar-system, created by Html and css. The error in the naming is my bad. It should be system, and not syetem. 
In this project, we aim to build a realistic solar system simulation that showcases the Sun and its planets orbiting in a harmonious celestial dance. By leveraging CSS animations, we can make the planets revolve around the Sun, emulating the natural behavior of the solar system
